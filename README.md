## üéÑAbout the game:
Welcome to the thrilling second edition of Charletacraft's Hardcore Server! In the coming days, you're set to embark on an unparalleled survival adventure, a standout journey in our server saga.

Here's the catch: death is final. Should you perish, your journey ends, relegating you to a spectator, never to rejoin the fray.

The challenge is formidable. Navigating in small teams is wise, especially during explorations. Excitingly, this edition features an expanded health pool with 30 hearts. A word of caution: overconfidence can be your downfall. Stay sharp, stay alive!

This server's map may not boast the largest scale in terms of admin-crafted expanses, yet it stands as our most finely tuned and optimized creation to date.
