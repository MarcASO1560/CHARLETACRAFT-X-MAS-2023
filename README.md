## About the game:
Welcome to the thrilling second edition of Charletacraft's Hardcore Server! In the coming days, you're set to embark on an unparalleled survival adventure, a standout journey in our server saga.

Here's the catch: death is final. Should you perish, your journey ends, relegating you to a spectator, never to rejoin the fray.

The challenge is formidable. Navigating in small teams is wise, especially during explorations. Excitingly, this edition features an expanded health pool with 30 hearts. A word of caution: overconfidence can be your downfall. Stay sharp, stay alive!

This server's map may not boast the largest scale in terms of admin-crafted expanses, yet it stands as our most finely tuned and optimized creation to date. Prepare to be captivated by an eclectic array of structures and natural wonders. From sprawling underground rivers stretching kilometers in length to towering mountains that soar over 270 blocks high, each element has been meticulously designed. This map represents a pinnacle of my work, skillfully balancing stability and maintaining the essence of playability. Explore and enjoy these marvels in a world crafted with precision and care.
